    "For this reason, every 100 years - namely, if the year number is divisible by 100 - a leap day is omitted. For example, the year 1900 was not a leap year, although it was divisible by four.\n",

    "Albeit this is almost sufficient, we need another adjustment every 400 years, then a leap day is inserted, although the year number is divisible by hundred. According to this rule, the year 2000 was a leap year for example.\n",
