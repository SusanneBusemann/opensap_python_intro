    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are needed in programming to run through a group of instructions multiple times. The Python programming language\n",
    "has two types of loops: the `while` loop and the `for` loop. The `for` loop is a language element that is very suitable\n",
    "for processing strings (letter by letter), lists (element by element) or number intervals. It can be used to execute one\n",
    "or more instructions on each element of the string/list/number interval.  \n",
    "Strings, lists and number intervals are members of the complex datatype called `sequences` like previously mentioned.\n",
    "Sequence just means that several parts follow each other. In a string, a letter follows after a letter; in a list, the\n",
    "individual list elements follow one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "When processing a sequence with a `for` loop, one element of the sequence is assigned to a *sequence-variable* in each\n",
    "iteration. For example, when a `for` loop iterates over a string, one character is processed in each loop pass. What is\n",
    "done in the processing part of the loop is determined by the instructions in the *loop body*. Just like `if-elif-else`,\n",
    "the loop body is specified by indenting. All instructions in the loop body are then executed. The general syntax of the\n",
    "`for` loop in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    instruction_1\n",
