    "\n",
    "So far we have only used primitive data types in our programs. However, these simple data types are quite limited.\n",
    "As an example consider the following task. You should write a Python üêç  program that performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let the user input several products of his/her shopping list \n",
    "- Once the user does not input further products\n",
    "    - Sort the products alphabetically\n",
    "    - Output the shopping list\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using only primitive data types and variables it is not possible to solve this task. The problem is, \n",
    "that you do not know before the program is executed how many varibles are necessary to store the\n",
    "user input. This is exactly why complex data types like lists are necessary. These data types enable the storage of multiple items. "

    "\n",
    "In Python squre brackets (i.e. `[` and `]`) are used to create a list. The individual items of the list are seperated by commas. Just like\n",
    "primitive data types, list can be assigned to variables. The following example shows a simple list containing different integer values.\n",
