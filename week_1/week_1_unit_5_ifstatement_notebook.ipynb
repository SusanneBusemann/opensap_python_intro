    "All your previous programs include a sequence of statements. After the start of the program the statements were\n",
    "executed step by step and the program ended afterwards. However, it is often necessary that parts of a program are\n",
    "only executed under certain conditions. For example, think of the following sentence and how it \n",
    "would be converted into a [pseudo code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) program:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If it rains tomorrow, I will clean up the basement. Then I will tidy the cupboards and sort the photos. Otherwise, I\n",
    "> will go swimming. In the evening I will go to the cinema with my wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textual description of the task is not precise. It is not exactly clear what is to be done.\n",
    "This is common for description in natural language. Often addition information is conveyed through the \n",
    "context of e.g. a conversation. What is probably meant in the previous example is the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   If it rains tomorrow, I will:\n",
    "      - clean up the basement\n",
    "      - tidy the cupboards\n",
