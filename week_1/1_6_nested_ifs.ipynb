According to the Gregorian calendar year, a year lasts exactly 365,2425 days, i.e. 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 12 seconds, or in other words: 31,556,952 seconds. You can see that, roughly speaking, a year is therefore a quarter of a day longer than 365 days.\n",
    " To correct this difference, leap days have been inserted. Every four years a leap day is inserted with the 29th of February.\n",
    " However, we make a new small \"mistake\" with it, because now we have a hundredth day too much. For this reason, every hundred years - in fact, if the year number is divisible by a hundred - a leap day is dispensed with. For example, the year 1900 was not a leap year, although it was divisible by four.\n",
    " One needs however still every 400 years a further corrective, then a leap day is inserted, although the year number is divisible by hundred. According to this rule, the year 2000 was a leap year.\n",
