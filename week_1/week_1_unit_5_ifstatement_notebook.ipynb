    "## Motivation\r\n",
    "All your previous programs include a sequence of instructions. After the start of the program the instructions were worked off step by step and the program ended afterwards. However, it is often necessary that parts of a program are only executed under certain conditions. For example the following sentence is to be converted into a [pseudo code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) program:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "> If it rains tomorrow, I will clean up the basement. Then I will tidy the cupboards and sort the photos. Otherwise, I will go swimming. In the evening I will go to the cinema with my wife.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Through textual description, it is not exactly clear what is to be done. Natural language often is unprecise. What is probably meant in this example is the following:\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "   If it rains tomorrow, I will:\r\n",
    "      - clean up the basement\r\n",
    "      - tidy the cupboards\r\n",
    "      - sort the photos\r\n",
    "   Otherwise (so if it doesn't rain), I will:\r\n",
    "      go swimming.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   In the evening I will go to the cinema with my wife.\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "So, depending on whether the condition is true or false, either one or the other path of the program is executed. This is illustrated in the following graphic:\r\n",

    "## Comparison operators\r\n",
    "So for conditional instructions a way to formulate conditions is needed. For this the relational operators can be used. With the relational operators shown in the following table it is possible to formulate instructions whose result is of the `Boolean` data type. As already explained, a `Boolean` data type can only be one of the two values `True` and `False`.\r\n",

    "A condition can be either `True` or `False`. In the first case the instructions are executed immediately after the condition is met. In the second case the instructions are executed after `else`. The `else` branch is optional, i.e. an `if` condition can also be specified without an `else` alternative. If the condition then is not true (i.e. `false`), the instructions of the `if` block are simply skipped."

    "Code blocks are instructions that belong together. are called code blocks. Here, for example, the instructions in the `if` or `else` branch of the conditional instruction.\r\n",
