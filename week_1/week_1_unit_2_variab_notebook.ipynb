    "\n",
    "Variables exist in (almost) every programming language. However, the term has a different meaning\n",
    "in programming compared to mathematics. In programming, a variable is a name to which a value can be\n",
    "assigned. From a (overly simplistic) technical point of view,\n",
    "a variable is space in the memory that has a certain value at a point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to put (or assign or write) a value into the variable. Vice versa, it is possible to read the currently stored value out of the variable. (Important: After the value of the variable is read, the value in the variable is still available and unchanged!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a variable can be set using the assignment operator `=`. For example, the assertion `a = 2` writes the value `2` into the variable `a`. If in subsequent statements, variable `a` is used, the value from the variable ist taken. For example in the following code cell, first the value `2` is written in to the variable `a`, then the value `3` is written into cell `b`. In the final statement, the values are read from variable `a` and `b` and multiplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In mathematics, `a = 2` is an *assertion*, which is either true or false. In programming, `a = 2` is an *instruction*, which describes the assignment of the value `2` to the variable `a`."
